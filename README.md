# Plant-Disease-detection-using-CNN

This project uses CNN, Convolutional Neural Network, to detect diseases in wheat plant at earlier stages.
It is implemented in Java. It uses a library called deeplearning4j, a popular library created by Eclipse.
This model uses the dataset made by us. It can predict the accuracy of the model(Cnn_Java_Implementation.java) and can also predict if a plant is infected or healthy(Single_prediction.java) using the trained model.
